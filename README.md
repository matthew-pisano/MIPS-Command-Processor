# MIPS Command Processor

Command Processor build using the MIPS assembly language, assembled using the MARS tool from Missouri State.  Developed as part of a college assembly course, the command processor leverages the low-level properties of assembly to carry out its functions using very lightweight code.

## Features and Function

This command processor in input from the Mars console emulator, and outputs to that same interface. Its features include:

- The ability to preform mathematical operations
- Bi-directional decimal and hexadecimal conversions
- Produce MIDI audio output
